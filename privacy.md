Last updated: 2026-01-31

AI Vault (“the App”) helps you save AI-generated answers, links, and notes for personal use.

## Summary
- Your saved items are stored **on your device**.
- The App does **not** require an account.
- The App may display ads using Google AdMob. Ad providers may collect data as described below.
- You can contact us at: walter@hmshost.top

## Data You Provide
The content you save in AI Vault (titles, notes, links, tags) is stored locally on your device. We do not require you to submit this content to us to use the App.

## Data Collected Automatically
### Advertising (Google AdMob)
If ads are enabled, the App uses Google Mobile Ads (AdMob) to display third‑party advertisements.

AdMob and its partners may collect and process information such as:
- Device identifiers (e.g., advertising identifiers)
- Approximate location (derived from IP address)
- Information about ads shown and interactions with ads (e.g., impressions, clicks)
- Diagnostic and performance information

This data is used to provide, measure, and improve advertising, and may be used for tracking depending on your device settings and consent choices.

For more information, see Google’s privacy policy:
https://policies.google.com/privacy

### Purchases
AI Vault offers an optional one‑time in‑app purchase (“Remove Ads”). Purchases are processed by Apple. We do not receive your payment card details.

## Tracking
If enabled, the App may request permission via Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework to allow tracking for advertising purposes. You can change your choice at any time in iOS Settings.

## How We Use Data
We use data only to:
- Provide the App’s features
- Display and measure advertising (when ads are enabled)
- Diagnose crashes and improve reliability

## Sharing
We do not sell your personal information. Advertising partners (such as Google) may process data as part of providing ads as described above.

## Data Retention
Your saved items remain on your device until you delete them or uninstall the App. Advertising-related data retention is governed by the ad provider.

## Your Choices
- You can remove ads by purchasing “Remove Ads”.
- You can limit ad tracking and reset your advertising identifier in iOS Settings.
- You can delete your saved items within the App.

## Children’s Privacy
AI Vault is not directed to children under 13.
